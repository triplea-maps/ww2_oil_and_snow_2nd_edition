ww2_oil_and_snow_2nd_edition

GAME INFO:

In this scenario you focus on securing oil to fuel your units and to deploy them wisely in various terrains & be aware of seasonal winter. It has a historical approach concerning weapon types development and minors joining the battlefield. Starting point is early April 1941: Greece is still unuccopied, the USSR respecting
its treaties with Germany and Japan & the USA is not yet involved. The USSR and USA are passive the first turn, they can purchase and place units but not move. Japan and Germany cannot attack USA or USSR in the first turn. ( partially due to non aggression treaties) From turn 2 all is possible!

Introduction: After playing many hours of A&A myself I started making own maps & models with the desire to improve tactical, geographical and historical aspects of WW2 strategic wargaming. When I entered the Triple A world ( quite late: 2020) I saw a living community working on a open source project and dozens of maps and ideas.

As for me personally a decent realistic WWII A&A-game should contain:

Terrain types, - Seasonal impact, -Oil use and production and a way to avoid picking out the casualties all the time yourself, 
which is surreal. And some placement and purchasiung limits to avoid the often seen >30 Infantry units stacking in capitals.

Besides I, with my teaching background, like to share less known aspects of history, to learn from. Like I added many collaborist volunteer units that played a part of the total forces in the field. And to play with soundfiles to give a good ambiance. I could not see a map combining all this so I started to make my own. It took some time but the momentum of 2020 there was suddenly the chance…..

Allthough my coding skills are limited , I learned a lot from trial trial and error error error. And by looking to some of the more sophisticated maps. Learning by doing and sometimes feeling desperate at java errors and unfindable bugs… is part of it….. Also making a comprise with own skills and the limits of the basic code is another, there are currently many more ideas that could be implemented if both ingredients worked along. Maybe one day….

Enjoy the result so far!

please any comments , bug reporting or tips: ( preferable in a list of issues not single posts &
java bugs please with turn nr. and which players set to A.I.)
